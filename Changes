0.09 2008-10-09

  - added docs for a few aliased methods, to keep Test::Pod::Coverage happy

0.08 

  - removed requirement for 5.8.4 (5.6 should be enough)

0.06 2006-01-24

  - switched the module to using Tree::XPathEngine to remove
    the dependancy on XML::Parser (which requires expat).

0.04 2004-05-22

  - the fake root is now created on the fly, so it leaves the
    original tree untouched

0.03 2004-05-20

    (including tests that fail with XML::XPath 1.13)

  - first working version

0.01 2004-05-17
